This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, setup the database:

```bash
npm run db:init
```

This will:
- Create a `data` directory in your project root
- Initialize a SQLite database (`games.db`) with the required tables:
  - `games` table for storing game metadata (title, description, thumbnail, etc.)
  - `game_categories` table for storing game categories
- Set up proper foreign key relationships between tables

Second, setup environment variables:
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env.local`
- Update the values in `.env.local` with your specific configuration


Third, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Database Management

The application uses SQLite for local data storage. The database file is located at `data/games.db`.

### Database Schema

**games table:**
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY) - Unique game identifier
- `buildName` (TEXT NOT NULL) - Internal build name for the game
- `title` (TEXT NOT NULL) - Display title of the game
- `description` (TEXT) - Game description
- `thumbnail` (TEXT) - Path to thumbnail image
- `details` (TEXT) - Additional game details
- `publisher` (TEXT) - Game publisher information
- `buildType` (TEXT DEFAULT 'unity') - Type of build ('unity' or 'html')

**game_categories table:**
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT) - Category identifier
- `game_id` (INTEGER NOT NULL) - Foreign key to games table
- `category` (TEXT NOT NULL) - Category name

### Database Operations

- **Initialize database:** `npx tsx scripts/init-db.ts`
- **Reset database:** Delete `data/games.db` and run the initialization script again
- **View database:** Use any SQLite browser tool to inspect `data/games.db`
